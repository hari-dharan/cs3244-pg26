# CS3244 PG26 Documentation

This mini-website is meant as both a short documentation regarding the things our team has done throughout our machine learning project, as well as a guide to our GitHub repository that will serve as a copy of its README. Furthermore, this documentation contains the plots accompanying our model evaluations as well as short write-ups to explain said plots.

# Model Evaluations
---
This section contains all the data visualisations and/or analyses that we have done for the three best models we have created and selected based on preliminary performance metrics. These performance metrics include the mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), $R^2$ (the coefficient of determination), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the median absolute percentage error (MdAPE).

# Credits
This website was built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). 

In this project, we have used various libraries and their API documentations. These include, but are not limited to:

* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html), a well-known library that has various implementations of things used in a machine learning pipeline.
* [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), an "optimised, distributed gradient boosting library".
* [TensorFlow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/), a deep learning library that is integrated with the [Keras](https://keras.io/api/) high-level API.
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/), a numerical computation library that is optimised for vectorised computations.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html), a plotting library built on top of Matplotlib.
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html), a plotting library.
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), a data manipulation library.
* [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/), a scientific computation library.
  
Additionally, [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) was used for model training.

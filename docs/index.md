# CS3244 PG26 Documentation
---
This mini-website is meant as both a short documentation regarding the things our team has done throughout our machine learning project, as well as a guide to our GitHub repository that will serve as a copy of its README. Furthermore, this documentation contains the plots accompanying our model evaluations as well as short write-ups to explain said plots.

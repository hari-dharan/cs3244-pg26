The dataset we chose was the [resale flat prices dataset](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices). This dataset contains the historical transactions of resale [Housing Development Board (HDB)](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/homepage) flats, detailing their sale month, town, flat type, HDB block, street name, storey range, flat area, flat model, lease commencement date, remaining lease period, and agreed resale (transacted) price. That being said, some of the files do not have the "remaining lease period" column, for which we can impute using the assumption that HDB flats have a 99-year lease starting from the lease commencement date, which is provided in all the data files.

We believe that the dataset is reliable given that it is provided by the Housing and Development Board and available for public download via the first link above. Furthermore, we can be confident that the data is updated, as is indicated from its metadata given in the same link.

This section contains all the data visualisations and/or analyses that we have done for the three best models we have created and selected based on preliminary performance metrics. These performance metrics include the mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), $R^2$ (the coefficient of determination), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the median absolute percentage error (MdAPE).

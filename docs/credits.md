In this project, we have used various libraries and their API documentations. These include, but are not limited to:

* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html), a well-known library that has various implementations of things used in a machine learning pipeline.
* [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), an "optimised, distributed gradient boosting library".
* [TensorFlow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/), a deep learning library that is integrated with the [Keras](https://keras.io/api/) high-level API.
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/), a numerical computation library that is optimised for vectorised computations.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html), a plotting library built on top of Matplotlib.
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html), a plotting library.
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), a data manipulation library.
* [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/), a scientific computation library.
  
Additionally, [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) was used for model training.

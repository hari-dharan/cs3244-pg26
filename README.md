# Navigating the repository

* `data_raw`: All the raw data taken from our dataset sources
* `data_processed`: Data that has undergone some form of processing
* `docs`: Files for documentation website; necessary for MkDocs to function well
* `evaluations`: In-depth model evaluations we completed for three selected models, namely a rolling bagging regressor, rolling kNN regressor, and rolling XGBoost regressor. Preliminary performance metrics are computed in each model's Jupyter Notebook instead of here (these are under `models`).
* `site`: Compiled documentation website after running `mkdocs build`.
